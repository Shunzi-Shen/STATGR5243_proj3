`app_v7_GA.R` is the the source code of our webapp, which is modified based on our Project 2 product.

`event analysi.csv` is the original aggregated data from Google Analytics (GA), while `Simulated Dataset Construction Based on Google Analytics` explains how we simulate data based on the raw GA data.

We used `Data_Simulation.ipynb` to generate simulated data, and used `Data_Analysis_Final.ipynb` to construct EDA, statistical tests and analysis.
