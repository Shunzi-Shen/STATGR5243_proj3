# Effect of Button Color and Font Size on User Engagement in a Data Analysis Tool
`app_v7_GA.R` is the the source code of our webapp, which is modified based on our Project 2 product.

`event analysi.csv` is the original aggregated data from Google Analytics (GA), while `ab_test_data_with_eda.csv` is the data we simulated.

We used `simulate.R` to generate simulated data and `V1.R` to construct EDA, statistical tests and analysis.
